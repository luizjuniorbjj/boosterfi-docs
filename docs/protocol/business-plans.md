## Why USDC Only?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| :material-check: **Stability** | No exposure to volatile tokens |
| :material-check: **Transparency** | 1 USDC = $1 always |
| :material-check: **No Impermanent Loss** | Your principal stays intact |
| :material-check: **Real Yield** | Earnings in stablecoin, not inflationary tokens |

---

## Yield Calculation

Your earnings depend on:

1. **Your deposit size** — Larger deposits earn proportionally more
2. **Total pool size** — Your share of the pool
3. **Flash Loan volume** — More volume = more fees
4. **Time** — Yields accumulate continuously

### Formula

```
Your Daily Yield = (Your Deposit / Total Pool) × Daily Volume × 0.09% × 80%
```

## Important Notes

!!! warning "Risk Disclaimer"
    - Yields are variable and depend on Flash Loan volume
    - Past performance does not guarantee future results
    - Always do your own research (DYOR)
    - Never invest more than you can afford to lose
